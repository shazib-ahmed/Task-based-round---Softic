Task / Problem

Microservice Architecture Design in a NodeJS/NestJS Environment:

Scenario: You are tasked with designing a microservice architecture for an online retail system. This system should manage various aspects like product catalog, user accounts, orders, and payment processing.

Question: Describe how you would architect this system using NodeJS and NestJS. Discuss your choice of database(s) for each microservice, considering the type of data and interactions between services. Explain how these microservices will communicate with each other, ensuring data consistency, security, and system reliability. Include your approach to handling transactions, especially in a distributed system environment.

Ans :


Designing a microservice architecture for an online retail system using NodeJS and NestJS involves breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that can communicate with each other. Below is a high-level overview of the architecture, including database choices, communication patterns, and considerations for data consistency, security, and system reliability.


Microservices Overview:

Product Catalog Service:
Responsibilities: Manages product information, categories, and inventory.
Database: MongoDB for flexibility with JSON-like documents.

User Account Service:
Responsibilities: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile information.
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data and strong ACID compliance.

Order Service:
Responsibilities: Manages the order lifecycle, including creation, modification, and status tracking.
Database: MongoDB for order details and status, as it can handle complex data structures.
Payment Processing Service:

Responsibilities: Processes payments and interacts with external payment gateways.
Database: Relational database (e.g., MySQL) to ensure transaction consistency.
Communication Patterns:


RESTful APIs:
Use RESTful APIs for communication between microservices, making it simple and stateless.
Implement OpenAPI specifications for clear communication contracts.
Message Queues:

Integrate a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous communication.
Use queues for events like order placement, ensuring decoupling and scalability.



Data Consistency:

Event Sourcing:
Implement event sourcing for critical services like Order and Payment.
Events are stored and can be replayed to rebuild state, ensuring consistency.

Transactional Boundaries:
Clearly define transactional boundaries using a two-phase commit or saga pattern.
Handle failures gracefully and implement compensating transactions for rollback scenarios.


Security:

JWT Authentication:
Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
Implement OAuth2 for secure, token-based communication between services.

HTTPS:
Enforce HTTPS for all communication to secure data in transit.
Implement proper authentication and authorization checks at each microservice.
